# FinDash - Finance Dashboard 💳

**FinDash** is a conceptual, high-fidelity finance dashboard built to demonstrate modern UI/UX principles in a banking application. It features a sleek glassmorphism design, smooth animations, and a responsive layout for tracking finances, transferring money, and viewing transaction history.

## 🚀 About the Project

FinDash is designed to feel premium and futuristic. It moves away from traditional, flat banking interfaces to a more depth-oriented design using glassmorphism effects and subtle gradients. It allows users to view their total balance, quickly send money to contacts, and review recent activities with fluid transitions.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Glassmorphism UI**: Uses background blurs and semi-transparent layers to create a sense of depth and hierarchy.
-   **Interactive Balance Card**: Hide/Show balance toggle with a secured view state.
-   **Quick Actions**: One-tap access to Transfer, Request, Scan, and Add Money features.
-   **Quick Send Carousel**: Horizontally scrollable list of recent contacts for fast transfers.
-   **Live Animations**: Powered by **Framer Motion** for entrance animations and smooth interaction feedback.
-   **Transaction History**: Clean list view of recent credits and debits with visual indicators.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

-   **Next.js 16**: Utilizing the App Router for modern server-side rendering and routing.
-   **React 19**: Built with the latest React primitives.
-   **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience.
-   **Tailwind CSS v4**: For rapid, utility-first styling and responsive design.
-   **Framer Motion**: Adds production-quality animations to components.
-   **Lucide React**: Clean and consistent icon set.

## 🏗️ How It Works

1.  **App Structure**: Built using the Next.js **App Router** (`src/app`), ensuring optimized loading and routing.
2.  **Styling**: The distinctive "glass" look is achieved via Tailwind utility classes combined with custom CSS variables for gradients and blurs.
3.  **Data Flow**: Currently utilizes mock data services to simulate API responses for transactions and user details, allowing for instant UI prototyping without a backend.
4.  **Component Design**: Reusable components like `ActionButton` and `TransactionItem` keep the codebase modular and maintainable.
